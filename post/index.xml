      <description>How to (not) Give a Short Scientific Talk - My Experience as a Conference Assistant Being a conference assistant at the European Geoscience Union (EGU) General Assembly 2023 in Vienna (https://www.egu23.eu/), I had the opportunity to witness around 200 scientific talks due to my job in the &amp;ldquo;lecture rooms.&amp;rdquo; My main responsibilities included downloading and opening the PowerPoint/PDF slides of the speakers, adjusting the technical setup, managing the timer, handling the Zoom session for online participants, and communicating with the conveners who led the usually two-hour-long sessions consisting of ten eight-minute talks + two minutes for questions.</description>

      <description>I finally handed in my Physics master&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Heidelberg University! Let me first say thank you to all the wonderful people at the STACY/SPACY group at Heidelberg and Tübingen University that made my work possible and made the last year such a pleasant experience.
In the last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve tested a statistical method named Data Assimilation to reconstruct the climate of the last millennium by fusing information from speleothems and ice cores and so-called isotope-enabled climate models.</description>

      <title>First guided tours through the old town of Heidelberg</title>

      <description>After thinking about the idea for a few months, I finally started guiding small groups of Spanish speaking visitors and will give my fourth tour tomorrow.
I advertise my so-called Freetours (people can give whatever tip they like in the end) via the usual platforms Guruwalk and Freetour.com, where I offer two tours a week, although I did not always have people yet.
Now that I have gathered some reviews on these sites it should be easier to gather an audience (although I think that a small group of up to ~8 people is most enjoyable for everyone).</description>

      <description>My blog is now online! So this is it, I finally managed to publish my own blog. Using HUGO and Github pages it was actually simpler than I thought.
In the last years I always thought of having my own website, for sharing some stuff about things I do, maybe it is of interest to you.
For instance I have accompanied many international students who are starting at Heidelberg University. As some questions used to come up everytime, I thought that some basic information from a students perspective should be written on the internet, so this is what the entry Get started in Heidelberg is for.</description>

      <title>Hummus Recipe</title>

      <description>Why put the millionth Hummus Recipe online? Couldn’t you come up with something more creative? Well, for my first blog post I wanted to start with something that I think I know how to do. Probably Hummus is the thing I’ve cost most in my life at a variety of events. Hummus is simple to make, nourishing, healthy and delicious. After making your own Hummus you will never reach for supermarket Hummus again.</description>
