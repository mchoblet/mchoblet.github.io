      <title>First guided tours through the old town of Heidelberg</title>

      <description>After thinking about the idea for a few months, I finally started guiding small groups of Spanish speaking visitors and will give my fourth tour tomorrow.
I advertise my so-called Freetours (people can give whatever tip they like in the end) via the usual platforms Guruwalk and Freetour.com, where I offer two tours a week, although I did not always have people yet.
Now that I have gathered some reviews on these sites it should be easier to gather an audience (although I think that a small group of up to ~8 people is most enjoyable for everyone).</description>

      <description>My blog is now online! So this is it, I finally managed to publish my own blog. Using HUGO and Github pages it was actually simpler than I thought.
In the last years I always thought of having my own website, for sharing some stuff about things I do, maybe it is of interest to you.
For instance I have accompanied many international students who are starting at Heidelberg University. As some questions used to come up everytime, I thought that some basic information from a students perspective should be written on the internet, so this is what the entry Get started in Heidelberg is for.</description>

      <description>(English) In order to practice my Spanish skills and share the fascinating history of Heidelberg, I decided to become an independent tour guide for the summer months of 2022. You can find me on the usual freetour platforms, which I use to promote the tours (in spanish). If you are interested in a tour in English, French or German feel free to contact me.
(Español) Para poder practicar mi español, contar las fascinantes historias de Heidelberg y conocer a viajeros hispanohablantes decidí hacerme guía.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Mathurin (aka Mathu or Mathi), physics master student at Heidelberg University. I currently do data science with climate data from models and measurements as a member of the STACY/Climatology group.
I started studying physics without really knowing what kind of physics I&amp;rsquo;d like to do later. It was mostly the urge to &amp;ldquo;perceive whatever holds the world together in its inmost folds&amp;rdquo;(Goethe&amp;rsquo;s Faust) which brought to that decision. The wide range of physics related topics offered at Heidelberg University gives a broad overview of the field, but at the same time does not facilitate the choice of which direction to choose.</description>

      <description>Information for new students in Heidelberg Hello visitor, where ever you come from!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a new student arriving in Heidelberg from abroad I hope this is the blog you were looking for. I helped some new students in Heidelberg during the last years and wanted to gather the most important information once and for all at one place.
My focus lies on sharing personal experiences and letting you save money whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Hummus Recipe</title>

      <description>Why put the millionth Hummus Recipe online? Couldn’t you come up with something more creative? Well, for my first blog post I wanted to start with something that I think I know how to do. Probably Hummus is the thing I’ve cost most in my life at a variety of events. Hummus is simple to make, nourishing, healthy and delicious. After making your own Hummus you will never reach for supermarket Hummus again.</description>
