      <description>My blog is now online! So this is it, I finally managed to publish my own blog. Using HUGO and Github pages it was actually simpler than I thought.
In the last years I always thought of having my own website, for sharing some stuff about things I do, maybe it is of interest to you.
For instance I have accompanied many international students who are starting at Heidelberg University. As some questions used to come up everytime, I thought that some basic information from a students perspective should be written on the internet, so this is what the entry Get started in Heidelberg is for.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Mathurin (aka Mathu or Mathi), physics master student at Heidelberg University, currently working on Data Assimilation with climate model output and proxy data for the last millenium as part of the STACY/Climatology group based at Tuebingen university.
Starting from April 2022 I offer guided Freetours in spanish language in Heidelberg. Besides hoping to improve my communicative and narrative skills, I hope to be able to tell interesting stories to my audience.</description>

      <description>Information for new students in Heidelberg Hello visitor, whereever you come from!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a new student arriving in Heidelberg from abroad this is the blog you were looking for. I helped some new students in Heidelberg during the last years and wanted to gather the most imporant information once and for all at one place.
My focus lies on sharing personal experiences and letting you save money whenever possible.</description>

      <description>Why put the millionth Hummus Recipe online? Couldn’t you come up with something more creative? Well, for my first blog post I wanted to start with something that I think I know how to do. Probably Hummus is the thing I’ve cost most in my life at a variety of events. Hummus is simple to make, nourishing, healthy and delicious. After making your own Hummus you will never reach for supermarket Hummus again.</description>
