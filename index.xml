      <title>My experience at the European Geoscience Union General Assembly 2023</title>

      <description>More than a month ago, I had the privilege of attending the EGU 2023 in Vienna, which marked my first scientific conference. In this blog post, I want to summarize my experiences of presenting a poster and working as a conference assistant, which kept me busy throughout the week. I never thought I would get such a high dose of Geosciences during one week.
What is the EGU? The European Geoscience Union General Assembly (EGU) is the second-largest geosciences conference globally, following its American counterpart, the AGU.</description>

      <description>Being a conference assistant at the European Geoscience Union (EGU) General Assembly 2023 in Vienna (https://www.egu23.eu/), I had the opportunity to witness around 200 scientific talks due to my job in the &amp;ldquo;lecture rooms.&amp;rdquo; My main responsibilities included downloading and opening the PowerPoint/PDF slides of the speakers, adjusting the technical setup, managing the timer, handling the Zoom session for online participants, and communicating with the conveners who led the usually two-hour-long sessions consisting of ten 8-minute talks + 2 minutes for questions.</description>

      <description>I finally handed in my Physics master&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Heidelberg University! Let me first say thank you to all the wonderful people at the STACY/SPACY group at Heidelberg and Tübingen University that made my work possible and made the last year such a pleasant experience.
In the last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve tested a statistical method named Data Assimilation to reconstruct the climate of the last millennium by fusing information from speleothems and ice cores and so-called isotope-enabled climate models.</description>

      <title>First guided tours through the old town of Heidelberg</title>
      <link>https://mchoblet.github.io/post/firsttours/</link>

      <description>After thinking about the idea for a few months, I finally started guiding small groups of Spanish speaking visitors and will give my fourth tour tomorrow.
I advertise my so-called Freetours (people can give whatever tip they like in the end) via the usual platforms Guruwalk and Freetour.com, where I offer two tours a week, although I did not always have people yet.
Now that I have gathered some reviews on these sites it should be easier to gather an audience (although I think that a small group of up to ~8 people is most enjoyable for everyone).</description>

      <title>Blog now online</title>

      <description>My blog is now online! So this is it, I finally managed to publish my own blog. Using HUGO and Github pages it was actually simpler than I thought.
In the last years I always thought of having my own website, for sharing some stuff about things I do, maybe it is of interest to you.
For instance I have accompanied many international students who are starting at Heidelberg University. As some questions used to come up everytime, I thought that some basic information from a students perspective should be written on the internet, so this is what the entry Get started in Heidelberg is for.</description>

      <description>I finished my studies in Heidelberg in December 2022 and don&amp;rsquo;t live there any longer, so I am not giving the tours anymore. I will transfer this webpage into a blogpost about my experiences at some point
(English) In order to practice my Spanish skills and share the fascinating history of Heidelberg, I decided to become an independent tour guide for the summer months of 2022. You can find me on the usual freetour platforms, which I use to promote the tours (in spanish).</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Mathurin! Glad you found my web page.
I’m currently a PhD student in Oceanography at the University of Liège, working on physical-biogeochemical ocean modeling in the MAST group. My research focuses on modeling sediments in the Black Sea of both biogenic and mineral origin.
With a background in Physics from the University of Heidelberg, where I completed both my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and Master&amp;rsquo;s degrees, my journey in climate science began during my time at the STACY/Climatology group group.</description>

      <description>Information for new students in Heidelberg Updated last time in February 2023
Hello visitor, where ever you come from!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a new student arriving in Heidelberg from abroad I hope this is the blog you were looking for. I helped some new students in Heidelberg during the last years and wanted to gather the most important information once and for all at one place.
My focus lies on sharing personal experiences and letting you save money whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Hummus Recipe</title>

      <description>Why put the millionth Hummus Recipe online? Couldn’t you come up with something more creative? Well, for my first blog post I wanted to start with something that I think I know how to do. Probably Hummus is the thing I’ve cost most in my life at a variety of events. Hummus is simple to make, nourishing, healthy and delicious. After making your own Hummus you will never reach for supermarket Hummus again.</description>
