<p>Hello visitor, whereever you come from!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a new student arriving in Heidelberg from abroad this is the blog you were looking for.
I helped some new students in Heidelberg during the last years and wanted to gather the most imporant information once and for all at one place.</p>
<p>My focus lies on sharing personal experiences and letting you save money whenever possible.</p>
<p>I plan to maintain this webpage for at least a few years. If any information is missing or outdated, or if something was particulary useful let me know via <a href="mathurin@choblet.com">mail</a> or in the comments. Thanks!</p>

<h3 id="topics-not-covered-here">Topics not covered here</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enrolment procedure</li>
<li>Visa procedure/Residence permit</li>
<li>Health insurance:  Make sure you have health insurance and that you pay your bills on time (you could be exmatriculated from the university, what might get you in the no immatriculation - no visa - vicious circle!)
If you&rsquo;re an EU resident your health-insurance card with the EU logo is probably sufficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you have them arranged before arriving or at least have plan of what to do. This might get really complicated, and it&rsquo;s absolutely legimate to demand help from the university administration.</p>
<p>Since recently (2021) there is also a <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/courses/prospective/admission_int/guide/online_guide_index.html">guide by the international office of the university</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tuition-fees-at-heidelberg-university">Tuition fees at Heidelberg University</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for the whole federal region of Baden-Württemberg since 2017 a tuition fees for students from outside the EU is applied. 1500€ may does not seem much in comparison to other countries, but Baden-Württemberg is the only region in germany applying this fee, so you might get similar education without having to pay 1.5k € every semester (paid at once) at universities outside of Bawü.</p>
<p>Students from inside the EU have to pay an administration fee for 170€ per semester.</p>
<h2 id="travelling-from-frankfurt-airport-to-heidelberg-main-station">Travelling from Frankfurt Airport to Heidelberg main station</h2>
<p><strong>Bus</strong>
You can take the &ldquo;Flixbus&rdquo; to Heidelberg, where you have to buy the ticket in advance online.
The bus will take you directly to Heidelberg main station without having to change. If you book early in advance you might be able to get a ticket for ~10€. There is also the Frankfurt Airport Shuttle to Heidelberg, for students it costs 18 instead of 29€.</p>
<p><strong>Train</strong>
In order to go the frankfurt airport train station you need to go to Terminal 1.
The main train operator in germany is called Deutsche Bahn, download the app or check their webpage for connections. There is no direct connection to Heidelberg, so you&rsquo;ll have to change the train at some point, You can buy tickets at a machine, but if you book some weeks in advance you can get cheaper tickets ( ~20€ instead of 28€). There are two types of tickets, &ldquo;Sparpreis&rdquo; means you can take only the train you booked, &ldquo;Flexpreis&rdquo; allows you to take any train of the same type (S,RB,RE,ICE) on that day.</p>
<p>If you plan to travel around a bit in germany via train it pays off quickly to have  a 50% discount card called Bahncard 50 for a year. The version for students (until 27 years) is called myBahncard and costs ~70€.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-live-in-heidelberg">Where to live in Heidelberg</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-accomodations">Types of accomodations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Student residence</strong><br>
The student dorms are managed by the <em>Studierendenwerk</em>,  which is a public instituion providing social, financial and cultural support services to students in Heidelberg.
As an international student is can be easier than for locals to get a room in the student dorms. It is the cheapest place to live in Heidelberg and it recomendable. You can get apartments where you share a kitchen and bath with just one other or eventually more than 10 people, you never have to share a room with someone else. The administration is student friendly and not profit oriented and they have staff that talks english.
The situation on the housing market is really tense, so if you want to go to the student residence apply several months in advance.
If you don&rsquo;t want to have a lot of huzzle looking for a room and don&rsquo;t want to spend much money (less than 300€) I really recommend to go for a student dorm room. Don&rsquo;t be too selective in the online application form regarding where/how to live, that will increase your chances to get a room.
Make sure everything with your application is fine and ask them if you have doubts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shared flat on the free market</strong><br>
The most used platform for finding a shared flat is <em>WG gesucht</em>. For a shared flat it is common to pay at least 300€, depending on the city district also more than 400€. You&rsquo;ll have to contact people there writing a bit about yourself.
Unfortunately the platform is sometimes crowded with cheap offers from fraternities (Studentenverbindungen), male societies with a doubtful historical past. Writing them is very likely waste of time.
The Studierendenwerk also offers an <a href="https://www.stw.uni-heidelberg.de/en/living_online_private_rooms">information board</a> for finding flats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="districts-of-the-city">Districts of the city</h3>
<p>In general you can consider living in every part of Heidelberg, especially if you have a bike you can get around in less than 30 minutes from one end of the city to the other. The central districts like Handschuhsheim, Neuenheim and the Altstadt will be more expensive of course. Some districts are less wealthy than others, but all are safe.</p>
<h3 id="cities-outside-heidelberg">Cities outside Heidelberg</h3>
<p>When looking for a flat you can also look for nearby cities which are not part of Heidelberg. For instance Dossenheim is actually really near the Campus Neuenheimer Feld. Also Eppelheim and even Leimen can be an option, check the distance to your institute on google maps. Up the river Neckar (towards the east) you might also find a cheap flat in Neckargemünd/Neckarsteinach etc., but here you will depend on the public transportation (S-Bahn). The big city of Mannheim may also be an option, the S-Bahn to Heidelberg main station takes 12 minutes, but Mannheim is also not so cheap and depending on where you find a flat the total trip to the university may be long.</p>
<h2 id="starting-at-the-university">Starting at the university</h2>
<p>Before you arrive you might:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get a buddy: The international office offers a buddy programm for international students, meaning that you can get in touch with a student from Heidelberg, likely from the subject of your studies. This can be extremely useful, for instance for selecting your courses. You can register <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/advisory-services/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have an account on a social network like facebook you can look for expat/tandem learning groups for Heidelberg in order to connect with people from Heidelberg. You can also follow what organisations like AEGEE are planning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first days the international relations office guide has some info, e.g. about the residence permit. If you go to the university administration (Seminarstraße 2) you can also validate your student ID card if you have it already (you need to put it into a validation machine every semester in order to have the current semester printed on the back).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="public-transportcommunication">Public transport/Communication</h2>
<h4 id="public-transportation">Public transportation</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tickets can not be bought inside the train. You can buy them via an app or at the ticket-machines, Preisstufe 2 inside Heidelberg (it is expensive (&gt;2€) even with the Bahncard 50 discount)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Student ID: If you have a validated student ID you can use the public transportation in Mannheim and Heidelberg for free on weekends, holidays and on week days after 7pm. This is due to the <a href="https://www.stura.uni-heidelberg.de/angebote/semesterticket/">administration fee</a> students pay to the university every semester</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Semester ticket:  Costs aprox 180€ for a 6 month period and allows you to freely travel around the region handled by the service provider. In my opinion the semester ticket is in general a bad deal. It is expensive, the region is ill-shaped (you don&rsquo;t even get to Karlsruhe or Frankfurt) and the service is not very frequent. I would recommend getting a bike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neun-Euro-Ticket (<strong>Summer 2022</strong>): In March 2022 the german government announced to heavily subsidize public transportation as part of a relief package due to the current energy crisis. Since May/June (?) there will be a monthly <a href="https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/german-expat-news/energy-relief-package-unveiled-grants-fuel-tax-cut-cheap-train-bus">public transportation ticket for nine euros</a>. It might even be valid for whole Germany.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bahn Card: If you plan to travel around Germany by train during the year I recommend getting a MyBahnCard 50, which is a reduced version of the Bahncard 50 (until 27 years).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cycling">Cycling</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Riding a bike is fun and lets you get enough exercise for the day. One can get used to it quickly. Inside Heidelberg you can get to every place in less than 30 minutes. Imo, having a bike in Heidelberg is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uak8TG6Z9-w">necessary</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next-bike (Bike sharing): The students parlament (Stura) negotiated a deal with the bike sharing company Next-bike that lets you use their bikes 30 minutes for free (as many times as you like during a day). For the account you have to use your uni-email-account, check more details <a href="https://www.stura.uni-heidelberg.de/angebote/vrnnextbike/">here</a> (in german). You need to charge at least a 1€ balance to your account and then can use nextbike for free.Unfortunately you can not leave the shared bike at any place but only at specific locations. Nextbike can also be used for free in other german cities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-scooter">E-Scooter</h4>
<p>Many sharing companies emerged in Heidelberg during the last years. E-scooters produce a lot of e-waste and are parked crazely everywhere, please don&rsquo;t use them. Get a bike, that&rsquo;s also way cheaper in the end.</p>
<h2 id="at-the-university">At the University:</h2>
<h3 id="selecting-courses">Selecting courses:</h3>
<p>The digital infrastructure related to selecting courses is spread over a bunch of services, thus it may seem confusing at first. Keep in mind that in case you do not manage to register for a course online it is also always possible to just go to a course/tutorial directly and ask the prof/tutor for how to do it.</p>
<h4 id="lsf"><strong>LSF</strong></h4>
<p>The central database for all courses is the <a href="https://lsf.uni-heidelberg.de/">LSF</a>, there you can browse through the list of courses offered at every faculty and this is the first place you should look at for planning your semester (database updated 1-2 months before the upcoming semester)
All the courses that are offered have to be listed there, the entries for the lecture normally contain the most basic information (lecturer, time and place, Credit points, Lecture Token (as found in the the module manuals). Although it might look like the LSF is the place where you register for your courses, most of the cases it is not, subjects like maths and physics use their own system (see below).
The LSF has a timetable option where you can add courses to in order to plan your weekly time schedule. Adding a course to your LSF timetable does not necesarilly mean you registered for it.</p>
<h4 id="uebungsgruppenverwaltung-physics-only"><strong>Uebungsgruppenverwaltung</strong> (Physics only)</h4>
<p>The Physics faculty uses its own system for course administration, the <a href="https://uebungen.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/uebungen/">ÜGV</a>.
You can log in via your university account (uni-id + password).
Here you can register for the courses, if there are tutorials for this lecture signing up for a tutorial automatically implies being signed up for the lecture. There you will also find more detailed information than in the LSF. Exercise sheets are also often uploaded on the Uebungsgruppenverwaltung.
It is not mandatory and sometimes not even possible to register for courses before the semester start, for seminars you often have to contact the professor directly to get a topic for the talk you have to prepare. Note that not all physics courses actually use the ÜGV-system.</p>
<h4 id="muesli-mathcomputer-science-only"><strong>Muesli</strong> (Math/Computer Science only)</h4>
<p>The faculty of maths and computer science has its own course administration system called <a href="https://muesli.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/user/login">Muesli</a>.
For logging in you have to create a separate account, you do not need to be immatriculated yet.</p>
<h3 id="getting-connected-to-wifi">Getting connected to WIFI</h3>
<p>In Heidelberg there is a publicly available WIFI service, called <a href="https://www.heidelberg.de/hd/HD/Rathaus/kostenloses+wlan.html">Heidelberg4You</a> which is also accesible from all public routers in the university.
Using the eduroam network is more recommended from a privacy standpoint. For info about how to get access look <a href="https://www.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/service-catalogue/network/wi-fi-via-eduroam">here.</a></p>
<h3 id="using-public-printers">Using public printers:</h3>
<p>The basic way to print documents goes the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload your document on this webportal: <a href="https://ricoh-eop.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/login.cfm?dest=index.cfm&amp;">https://ricoh-eop.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/login.cfm?dest=index.cfm&amp;</a></li>
<li>Go to one of the Ricoh printers (e.g. at the university libraries), log in with your uni account.</li>
<li>Print by paying with your Student ID card (can be recharged at the Mensa)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="other-useful-pages-regarding-study-regulations-and-organization">Other useful pages regarding study regulations and organization:</h3>
<p>In general the module manual (Modulhandbuch in german) of your subject is the most important document to look at. If you had to fill out a learning agreement as part of an Erasmus stay you probably know the module manual already. It contains a list of courses/modules that you have to do in your studies and also contains some kind of timetables for what you should do at what point of your studies.
Keep in mind that what is written there are in general only suggestions, you do not have to study like that and also do not have to do 30 credits per semesters as suggested there. Finishing a degree might have time limits (e.g. for the physics master 4+3 extra semesters), these kind of regulations are written down in the <em>Prüfungsordnung</em>, in the year 2022 these documents are only available in german at Heidelberg university.
It depends on the subject if these studylimits are rigorously enforced or not, do not be too worried if you think you need some extra semesters
Some faculties offer information on website like FAQ and answers, e.g. the <a href="https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/infopa/faq.html">physics examination board</a>.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-courses">Types of courses</h2>
<p>Here some basic description of the types of courses offered at the university (especially in maths/computer science/physics, it can be completly different in the humanities), you might encounter these names while browsing through the course list in the LSF. For an exact description look in the module manual of your subject.</p>
<h4 id="lectures-vorlesungen"><strong>Lectures</strong> (Vorlesungen)</h4>
<p>A profesor present the content of a course following a script/book.
Presence is not mandatory.</p>
<h4 id="tutorials-tutorien"><strong>Tutorials</strong> (Tutorien)</h4>
<p>In order to get admited to the final exam of a lecture (or to just pass the course) you have to submit weekly exercise sheets. The solution of these exercises (can be solved in teams) are presented in a tutorial. Presence is not mandatory, nonetheless it can be really useful to go there, one learns the course content through the exercises.</p>
<h4 id="seminars"><strong>Seminars</strong></h4>
<p>In a seminar students have to present a research topic/publication, attend their fellow students presentations and write a final report.</p>
<h4 id="journal-clubresearch-seminaroberseminar">Journal Club/Research seminar/Oberseminar:</h4>
<p>This is a fuzzy thing. Some module manuals include attending Journal Clubs/Research seminars  as an opportunity to get Credit points. Nonetheless some of these events you can find in the LSF are just a group meeting in disguise, meaning that it does not make so much sense to go there as a regular student. If you&rsquo;re interested in the topic its best to contact the professor.</p>
<h2 id="student-representatives">Student representatives</h2>
<p>The students representatives organisation for each subject is called &ldquo;Fachschaft&rdquo;. The people active there are in general happy to help other people. They may give your tips regarding lectures and lecturers, how to plan your studies and may have a database for previous exam problems from the last years. Look for &ldquo;Fachschaft + &lt; your subject &gt; + Heidelberg&rdquo; on google and you&rsquo;ll find how to contact them.
The Maths/Physics/Computer Science representatives, <a href="www.mathphys.info">Fachschaft MathPhysinfo</a> organize a welcome session for new students every semester, a recording of this presentation can be watched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grDaC59Ko1c">Youtube</a>.</p>
<h2 id="german-language-courses">German language courses</h2>
<p>Especially if you plan to stay longer in Germany, for instance if you want to do your complete master here I&rsquo;d really recommend doing a language course, even if your courses are held in english. With students of your age you&rsquo;ll probably have no problem at all communicating in english only, but if you want to break out of your student bubble (I always find that a good idea) it&rsquo;s is valuable to have at least some basic knowledge of german.</p>
<p>There is for instance the <a href="https://isz.uni-heidelberg.de/d_kurse.html">Internationales Studienzentrum</a> of the university, the <a href="https://www.idf.uni-heidelberg.de/institut/tandemprogramm.html">tandem programm</a> if you already have basic knowledge of german, or many different language schools in Heidelberg (Heidelberg Pädagogium, Alpha Activ, F+U and many more). The quality of teaching might vary from teacher to teacher, and in case you really don&rsquo;t have a good feeling at the beginng of a course, don&rsquo;t mind insisting switching to another course.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-life">Cultural life</h2>
<h3 id="theatre-and-opera">Theatre and Opera</h3>
<p>Heidelberg theatre offers theater plays, operas and classic music concerts. As a student you only pay half the price, furthermore there are some free student tickets that are accessible five days before the event. More info on how to access it can be found on this page: <a href="https://www.theaterheidelberg.de/karten/neu-studi-flatrate/">https://www.theaterheidelberg.de/karten/neu-studi-flatrate/</a>
It&rsquo;s also good to know that your theatre entry is also valid as a public transportation ticket on the day of the event.</p>
<p>If you want to see the big classic operas you can also consider going to the national theater in Mannheim. You can also get cheap student tickets ~10€ there, also here the public transportation ticket to Mannheim is included in your ticket.</p>
<h3 id="cinema">Cinema</h3>
<p>My favourite cinema in Heidelberg is the small <a href="https://www.karlstorkino.de/">Karlstorkino</a> in the old town. Its an arthouse cinema that shows all kind of movies, old classics, documentaries and also new productions. The movies are always shown in original language, what is unfortunately not so common in Germany.
There is also the <a href="https://www.gloria-kamera-kinos.de/">Gloria/Kamera-cinema</a> in the Hauptstraße/Brückenstraße which offers movies in original language and is a nice place to go out.
We also have a big movietheater in the Bahnstadt called Luxorkino if you want to see blockbuster movies, but it&rsquo;s really expensive to see a movie there (&gt;12€).</p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>For life in germany in general there are many valuable expat blogs online, therefore I keep my thoughts rather short.</p>
<h2 id="cell-phone-contract">Cell phone contract:</h2>
<p>One of the first things you probably want to do when you arrive in Germany (especially if you&rsquo;re from outside the EU) is getting a german cell phone contract. Note that for getting one you need to have a bank account for most of them. Prepaid contracts are not very common.
A rule of thumb is that you do not need to pay more than 10€ for a monthly contract with a reasonable amount of data and unlimited calls inside Germany. The cheapest contracts are found on the internet and not in the stores of the larger companies in the cities (Vodafone, O2, Telekom).
There are many different companies, that use four different networks, if you want to check the coverage look for &ldquo;Netzabdeckung&rdquo; on the internet.
During the last years I had contracts at one of the Drillisch subcompanies (they own a whole set of discount cell phone contract provides, like handyvertrag.de . They rotate their tarifs between companies, but basically they are all the same) and it was always fine for me. Getting a 24 month contract is cheaper, for a monthly one you have to pay some extra amount once in the beginning (Bereitstellungsgebuehr).</p>
<h2 id="bank-account">Bank Account</h2>
<p>One important thing to know is that there are still some banks out there that offer you a visa card for free without an account management fee (Note that we also use a debit card in germany called Giro/EC/Maestro-Card, but this is not a credit card!). Some pure online banks like N26 or DKB might be the bank of your choice. Of course you can also go to a classical bank branch office you find around the place you live (Volksbank, Sparkasse &hellip;), but normally they do not offer an account for free. Although it might be less obvious to withdraw money without a fee for one of the online banks, they let you retrieve money at supermarkets for instance. It is not possible to pay by card in every situation in Germany (for instance at the bakery), so you should always have a small amound of cash with you at least.</p>
<h2 id="german-broadcast-fee-rundfunkbeitrag">German broadcast fee (Rundfunkbeitrag)</h2>
<p>In germany public broadcast is financed by a fee that is paid by <em>every household</em>, meaning that you have to share the monthly fee with your flatmates. And if you&rsquo;re looking for a way to get around it, sorry, there are few exceptions and as an international student it is unlikely you can be part of it (<a href="https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/welcome/englisch/index_ger.html#exemption_and_reduction)">https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/welcome/englisch/index_ger.html#exemption_and_reduction)</a>.
After you have registered as an inhabitant of Heidelberg the agency will write you a letter that is probably redudant because your flatmates may already have registered the flat. Ask them to give you the according number to register online and not get bothered by the &ldquo;Beitragsservice). Make sure you have done this in time or you may have to pay some fine.</p>
