      <description>A collection of presentations and reports I did throughout my studies.
Master thesis (2022) My thesis is about applying methods from Data Assimilation to climate model data and terrestial proxies (speleothemes and icecores) (I will for sure do a blog post at one point)
 Outline presentation of the project Update presentation (focus on computational efficiency of different type of Ensemble Kalman Filters) Paper discussion in our climate variability Journal club.</description>

      <description>(English) In order to practice my Spanish skills and share the fascinating history of Heidelberg, I decided to become an independent tour guide for the summer months of 2022. You can find me on the usual freetour platforms, which I use to promote the tours (in spanish). If you are interested in a tour in English, French or German feel free to contact me.
(Español) Para poder practicar mi español, contar las fascinantes historias de Heidelberg y conocer a viajeros hispanohablantes decidí hacerme guía.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Mathurin (aka Mathu or Mathi), physics master student at Heidelberg University. I currently do data science with climate data from models and measurements as a member of the STACY/Climatology group.
I started studying physics without really knowing what kind of physics I&amp;rsquo;d like to do later. It was mostly the urge to &amp;ldquo;perceive whatever holds the world together in its inmost folds&amp;rdquo;(Goethe&amp;rsquo;s Faust) which brought me to that decision.</description>

      <description>Information for new students in Heidelberg Hello visitor, where ever you come from!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a new student arriving in Heidelberg from abroad I hope this is the blog you were looking for. I helped some new students in Heidelberg during the last years and wanted to gather the most important information once and for all at one place.
My focus lies on sharing personal experiences and letting you save money whenever possible.</description>
