      <description>I finally handed in my Physics master&amp;rsquo;s thesis at Heidelberg University! Let me first say thank you to all the wonderful people at the STACY/SPACY group at Heidelberg and Tübingen University that made my work possible and made the last year such a pleasant experience.
In the last year, I&amp;rsquo;ve tested a statistical method named Data Assimilation to reconstruct the climate of the last millennium by fusing information from speleothems and ice cores and so-called isotope-enabled climate models.</description>

      <title>First guided tours through the old town of Heidelberg</title>

      <description>After thinking about the idea for a few months, I finally started guiding small groups of Spanish speaking visitors and will give my fourth tour tomorrow.
I advertise my so-called Freetours (people can give whatever tip they like in the end) via the usual platforms Guruwalk and Freetour.com, where I offer two tours a week, although I did not always have people yet.
Now that I have gathered some reviews on these sites it should be easier to gather an audience (although I think that a small group of up to ~8 people is most enjoyable for everyone).</description>

      <description>A collection of presentations and reports I did throughout my studies.
Reanalysis of South American Hydroclimate (Publication in preparation) Soon!
Master thesis (2022) My thesis was about applying methods from Data Assimilation to climate model data and terrestial proxies (speleothemes and icecores) for reconstructing climate fields. You can access it here:
 Thesis  I gave the following talks about my master thesis
 Master final presentation Outline presentation of the project Update presentation (focus on computational efficiency of different type of Ensemble Kalman Filters) Paper discussion in our climate variability Journal club.</description>

      <description>Information for new students in Heidelberg Hello visitor, where ever you come from!
If you&amp;rsquo;re a new student arriving in Heidelberg from abroad I hope this is the blog you were looking for. I helped some new students in Heidelberg during the last years and wanted to gather the most important information once and for all at one place.
My focus lies on sharing personal experiences and letting you save money whenever possible.</description>
